# Form Builder

A dynamic web application that allows users to create and preview form fields in real-time. Users can add text inputs, checkboxes, or radio buttons to their form and see the preview instantly.

## Features

- **Field Types**: Supports three types of form fields:
  - Text Input
  - Checkbox (with up to 4 options)
  - Radio Button (with up to 4 options)
- **Real-time Preview**: As users select a field type and provide a label, the field is immediately displayed in the preview area.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works

1. **Select Field Type**: The user selects the type of form field they want to add (text, checkbox, or radio button).
2. **Enter Field Label**: The user provides a label for the field, which will appear next to the input in the preview.
3. **Checkbox/Radio Options**: For checkbox and radio button fields, the user is prompted to enter up to 4 options.
4. **Preview**: The form field is dynamically displayed in the preview area with its corresponding label and options.
